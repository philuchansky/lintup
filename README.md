# lintup
A tool for sharing and discovering useful code snippets.

Users can sign up for a free account and immediately begin contributing code snippets they find useful, and can also save other user's snippets by 'linting' them, which is a fancy word for 'liking' them.

# User Stories

As a user, I want to save my favorite code snippets by 'linting' them so that I can easily refer to them later.

As a user, I want to add code snippets using a browser-based 'text-editor' style input, so that I can maintain language syntax with indentation.

As a user, I want to quickly be able to 'unlint' a post, or, 'unlike' it, if I decide to, by clicking the same 'lint' button like a toggle switch.

As a user, I want to comment on other snippets with an editor that allows me to use markdown so that I can easily quote references.

As a user, I want to be able to see how many 'lints' my snippets have, and see a breakdown of how many snippets and total number of 'lints' I've got from my user profile page.

As a user, I want to be able to edit my profile information quickly and easily, including my name, email, password, username, and github link, in the event my contact info needs to be updated.
