# lintup
A tool for sharing and discovering useful code snippets.

Users can sign up for a free account and immediately begin contributing code snippets they find useful, and can also save other user's snippets by 'linting' them, which is a fancy word for 'liking' them.

# User Stories

As a user, I want to save my favorite code snippets by 'linting' them so that I can easily refer to them later.

As a user, I want to add code snippets using a browser-based 'text-editor' style input, so that I can maintain language syntax with indentation.

As a user, I want to comment on other snippets with an editor that allows me to use markdown so that I can easily quote references.
